# grunt-sftp-deploy

This is a [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) task for code deployment over the _sftp_ protocol. It is mostly a copy of [grunt-ftp-deploy](https://github.com/zonak/grunt-ftp-deploy), but uses [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2) to provide sftp access instead of [jsftp](https://github.com/sergi/jsftp). And when I say "mostly a copy," I mean I stole it all and added sftp. Including this readme, for now.

These days _git_ is not only our goto code management tool but in many cases our deployment tool as well. But there are many cases where _git_ is not really fit for deployment:

- we deploy to servers with only _sftp_ access
- the production code is a result of a build process producing files that we do not necessarily track with _git_

This is why a _grunt_ task like this would be very useful.

For simplicity purposes this task avoids deleting any files and it is not trying to do any size or time stamp comparison. It simply transfers all the files (and folder structure) from your dev / build location to a location on your server.

## Usage

To use this task you will need to include the following configuration in your _grunt_ file:

```javascript
'sftp-deploy': {
  build: {
    auth: {
      host: 'server.com',
      port: 22,
      authKey: 'key1'
    },
    cache: 'sftpCache.json',
    src: '/path/to/source/folder',
    dest: '/path/to/destination/folder',
    exclusions: ['/path/to/source/folder/**/.DS_Store', '/path/to/source/folder/**/Thumbs.db', 'dist/tmp'],
    serverSep: '/',
    concurrency: 4,
    progress: true
  }
}
```

and load the task:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-sftp-deploy');
```

The parameters in our configuration are:

- **host** - the name or the IP address of the server we are deploying to
- **port** - the port that the _sftp_ service is running on
- **authKey** - a key for looking up the saved credentials
- **cache** - boolean/string - put false or omit this parameter for no cache, otherwise provide path to cache file, so overwriten are only the files that has been changed (it works only for your local copy, so if someone else uploaded something meanwhile it will not be catched). Path is relative to your gruntfile, so you can easily clear cache by erasing this json file. This file should be omitted from source control.
- **src** - the source location, the local folder that we are transferring to the server
- **dest** - the destination location, the folder on the server we are deploying to
- **exclusions** - an optional parameter allowing us to exclude files and folders by utilizing grunt's support for `minimatch`. Please note that the definitions should be relative to the project root
- **serverSep** - an optional parameter allowing you to define the server separator in case it differs from your local environment. Useful if you deploy from Windows to Unix
- **concurrency** - an optional parameter to define the number of concurrent file transfer, default to 4
- **progress** - an optional parameter to display or not the progress bar

The progress bar is also disabled when --verbose switch is used.


## Authentication parameters

Usernames, passwords, and private key references are stored as a JSON object either in a file named `.ftppass` or in an environment variable.
The `.ftppass` file should be omitted from source control. The file or variable uses the following format:

```javascript
{
  "key1": {
    "username": "username1",
    "password": "password1"
  },
  "key2": {
    "username": "username2",
    "password": "password2"
  },
  "privateKey": {
    "username": "username"
  },
  "privateKeyEncrypted": {
    "username": "username",
    "passphrase": "passphrase1"
  },
  "privateKeyCustom": {
    "username": "username",
    "passphrase": "passphrase1",
    "keyLocation": "/full/path/to/key"
  },
  "privateKeyCustomByFileName": {
    "username": "username",
    "passphrase": "passphrase2",
    "keyLocation": "filename-of-key"
}
```

If `keyLocation` is not specified, `grunt-sftp-deploy` looks for keys at `~/.ssh/id_dsa` and `/.ssh/id_rsa`.

You can supply passwords for encrypted keys with the `passphrase` attribute.

This way we can save as many username / password combinations as we want and look them up by the `authKey` value defined in the _grunt_ config file where the rest of the target parameters are defined.

To use an environement variable instead of the `.ftppass` file, add the JSON string to your `~/.bashrc` (or equivalent), for example:
```bash
export GRUNT_SFTP="{
                    \"username\": \"your-username\",
                    \"keyLocation\": \"path/to/your/ssh/key\",
                    \"passphrase\": \"the-key-password\",
                  }"
```

Then you simply pass the variable name as the `sftp-deploy` tasks's `authKey` parameter inside your `Gruntfile.js`

If you are fetching credentials from different sources like internal grunt config objects or shell prompt there is another option. You can pass the object with key:value pairs like they are stored in `.ftppass` as `authKey` parameter.

## Dependencies

This task is built by taking advantage of the great work of Brian White and his [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2) _node.js_ module.
