#PHP OWASP Security

This is a series of video tutorials for Tuts+ demonstrating both common attack vectors 
and the solutions to stop them.  The OWASP Top Ten is used as a reference to show 
what the attacks are and how to stop them.  Even though I will try to cover them in order, 
it's important to understand that one type of attack often leads to other types of attacks, 
and that likewise, enabling security for one area prevents attacks across a broad 
spectrum of other areas.
